The board is shown using char[] board array of size 42 with a 7 x 6 grid, with each slot being empty or 'B'(Blue) or 'R' (Red). The Scanner class is used to take user input and select the mode. The mode variable stores the selected game mode (1 for Player vs Player, 2 for Random Computer, 3 for AI). Boolean variables like playAgain keeps the outer loop running for multiple games, playerTurn tracks whose turn it is, and gameEnded controls the gameplay loop. Two integer variables, blueWins and redWins, keep track of each player's score. This includes a while loop for repeated turns, input validation for selecting columns, and different move strategies for human players, a  random computer, or an AI. For the AI (mode 3), the computer tries to win, block the player, or pick randomly by temporarily placing its symbol and checking win conditions using inline horizontal, vertical, and diagonal logic.
